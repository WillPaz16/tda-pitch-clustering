Attractor Node Verification

Follow-up to an unverified observation in docs/DISCOVERY_FINDINGS.md: a
few specific nodes (cube59_cluster1, cube62_cluster2, cube62_cluster3)
showed up repeatedly as the destination of the largest-margin misroutes
from several different large neighboring hub clusters, which was flagged
as noticed-but-not-tested.

This checks it systematically: computes betweenness centrality (a
standard graph measure of how often a node lies on shortest paths between
other node pairs -- the network-theoretic definition of a "bridge" or
"crossroads" node) and large-neighbor count for every node, and compares
the three candidate nodes against other nodes of similar degree (since
raw attractor-ness could just be a trivial consequence of having high
degree in the first place).

Also reports each candidate node's baseball identity (dominant pitch
type, velocity, movement) and its largest neighbors', since a network
statistic on its own doesn't mean anything without grounding it in what
pitch shapes are actually involved.

Analysis/reporting script. See docs/DISCOVERY_FINDINGS.md for write-up.
