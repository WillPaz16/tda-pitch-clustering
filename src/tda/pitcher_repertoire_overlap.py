"""
Pitcher Repertoire Overlap in the Slider/Cutter Bridge Region

R&D-flavored follow-up to the verified finding in docs/DISCOVERY_FINDINGS.md
that the graph's real topological crossroads is a slider/cutter bridge band
(85-90mph, mild glove-side break) sitting between the curveball region and
the four-seam fastball region.

A network statistic and a movement chart are useful to a mathematician; a
player-development analyst wants a name (or ID) and an actionable question.
This checks: are there specific real pitchers whose two DIFFERENT labeled
pitch types (e.g. their own slider AND their own cutter) both land in this
bridge region, or in adjacent/overlapping nodes generally? That's the
concrete, actionable version of "this pitcher's two secondary offerings may
not be meaningfully differentiated in movement/velocity space" -- a real
conversation pitching coaches and pitch-design staffs have.

Analysis/reporting script. See docs/DISCOVERY_FINDINGS.md for write-up.

Note: pitcher identity is reported as Statcast/MLBAM pitcher_id, not name --
name resolution via pybaseball.playerid_reverse_lookup() was unavailable in
this environment (a Chadwick register parsing error, not a code issue with
this script). IDs can be cross-referenced manually on Baseball Savant.
